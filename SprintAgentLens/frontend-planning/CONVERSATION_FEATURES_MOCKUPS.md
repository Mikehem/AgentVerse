- ✅ `feedback` - User rating and feedback system

#### SpanData Integration:
- ✅ Span hierarchy visualization
- ✅ Parent-child relationships
- ✅ Start/end time waterfall charts
- ✅ Input/output data display
- ✅ Tags and metadata presentation
- ✅ Error information display

#### TraceData Integration:
- ✅ Trace-level metrics and timelines

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Primary User Journeys:

1. **Monitor Conversations** → Dashboard → Filter/Search → View Details
2. **Investigate Issues** → Search → Error Filter → Span Analysis → Resolution
3. **Analyze Performance** → Dashboard Metrics → Thread View → Trace Analysis
